# Modules

## PyPlot Module

This module will be using MatPlotLib PyPlot module to create plots.
Users shouldn't use this directly since the main plotting
functions are all inside the main module.

## Pandas Module

This module is used to detect Pandas objects.
Pandas is not needed to work with this library,
but it is supported anyway. It can use DataFrames
as data sources for the plotting functions.

## Styling Module

This module contains code related to styling the
plots. It contains functions and objects that can
be used to better customize the plots. In general,
they will not be used directly by the user.

## Utils Module

This module contains other utilities used by the
code. Nothing special.
